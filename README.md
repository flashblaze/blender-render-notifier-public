This is the public repo for releases, discussions, issue tracking etc related to my addon: **Render Notifier**.

# Changelog

## v1.1.0

- **Feature:** Add an option to disable notification for all frames while rendering animation and only send a notification when the complete animation is rendered. This is extremely useful when you're rendering more than **30 frames** to avoid constant bombardment of notifications.

## v1.0.0

- **1st Release!**
- **Feature:** Notify on Telegram when an image is rendered.
- **Feature:** Notify on Telegram when an image sequence is rendered.
- **Feature:** Notify on Telegram when a render is cancelled.
- **Feature:** Send stats of all frames rendered as a final notification when an image sequence is finished rendering.
